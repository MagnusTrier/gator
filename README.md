# Gator
#### A simple CLI news aggregator written in go

Here are the steps to get gator working in your terminal:

* In order to use Gator the user needs to have both Postgres and Go installed.
* Install the latest version of Gator using **go install github.com/MagnusTrier/gator@latest**
* In order for Gator to work properly you need to set up a file called **.gatorconfig.json**. This file should be located in your home folder and it needs to have the following structure: 
{
    "db_url": "your/db/url",
    "current_user_name": "someString"
}
